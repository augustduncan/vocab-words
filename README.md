### pull 
a pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch to another (is this what pull is though?) 
pull itself i think is just grabbing changes and merging them

### fetch
takes changes from the remote repository and moves them to your local copy of it. 

### push
sends your changes back to the remote repository (i am a little confused on how this is different from a pull request. none of the lessons i did talked about either push or fetch, maybe i missed something?)

### merge 
takes a branch that was created and merges it with the main branch, and adds the branch files to the base code. 

### commit
if you make changes to a file, or any kind of change, you save that change by committing it. the commits can be undone and the repository can be reset to a previous commit. 

### fork
a copy of another repository, but changes that are made are not connected to the main repository. (i dont really understand this, how is it different from cloning?)

### clone
makes a copy of a repository, a local copy is only on your computer but still connected to the main remote repository 

### branches 
a branch is an independent copy of the main code, which can be edited without impacting the main branch or any other branches, and once complete, can be merged with the main branch.
